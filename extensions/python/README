To build a python extension of SZMQ the following packages/libraries are required:
swig, gnutls, zmq

To build the extension follow these steps:
1. cd to the extensions/python directory in the szmq source directory.
2. Generate the swig wrapper file by running 
	swig -python szmq.i
3. Build the shared object file: 
	python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will generate the shared object file _szmq.so in the extensions/python directory
